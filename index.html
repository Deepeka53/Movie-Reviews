<h3>Moview review</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Berkshire Swash', cursive;font-size:20px;padding:5px 10px;">The plot unfolds as a cat-and-mouse game between hard-nosed cop Vikram (Madhavan, stylish and serious) and notorious gangster Vedha (Vijay Sethupathi, who is all swag and gets a kickass introduction scene). The film begins with an encounter operation that ends in some of Vedha’s men getting killed. And even as the team plots another encounter to finish off Vedha, the criminal surrenders — and, narrates a story from his life to Vikram before managing his ‘escape’! This happens two more times, but his stories are actually riddles that Vedha wants Vikram to solve, and lead him on to something that the two of them want.

There are about a dozen supporting players involved in this game between Vikram and Vedha. Vikram’s wife Priya (Shraddha Srinath), who is also Vedha’s lawyer; Vikram’s team, which includes SP Surendar (Achyutha Kumar), who has become disabled in the line of duty, and Simon (Prem), Vikram’s friend; Vedha’s brother Pulli (Kathir) and his girlfriend Chandra (Varalaxmi), who are pawns in a more dangerous game; Chetta (Haresh Peradi), a rival gangster whom Vedha is warring against; and also Vedha’s men, one of whom has been colluding with the cops.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Berkshire Swash', cursive;font-size:20px;padding:5px 10px;">This movie can also be called as an intellectual romance between vikram and vedha.At a point they're exchanging gifts and you're like "Guys go get a room!!"
The movie isn’t a war between good and evil but a war to find who is good and who is evil.
There is a line between Vikram and Vedha which separates the good(police) and the evil(criinal) from a general point of view but both of them are the good ones in their regions and are surrounded by evil so they were zoned out by the evil and made to sit face to face  as a representative of each sides so they would fight n kill each other in the name of justice but they’re smart..Vedha is more smarter(I’ll get back on it) they figured out they both belong to the same side and started pulling out the weed(the evil) growing on either sides(and destroy them). It is an intellectual romance between Vikram and Vedha. In the start Vedha says “we’re both the same”..it sound like Vedha is saying “we’re both sinners” but  the actual meaning is “we’ve been used by sinners”</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Berkshire Swash', cursive;font-size:20px;padding:5px 10px;">

Vikram Vedha is a film that begins even before its first scene. Even the anti-smoking/drinking disclaimer is cheeky, with Madhavan reading out the warning in English while Vijay Sethupathi does the honours in Tamil. It’s perhaps the actors speaking to their respective audiences, yet in a film about how easily a person labels another, it means much more.

The film really begins with a long, single-take shot where police officer Vikram (Madhavan), almost casually, gets ready for an encounter in an old abandoned warehouse. The encounter itself is executed without any fuss or drama, and even as Vikram and his team plants evidence to build a case of self defence, the mood is still that of colleagues chilling.

As Vikram sees it, it’s ‘just’ work and a policeman’s job is to kill the guilty. That’s why he’s able to sleep like a baby… even on nights when he’s killed someone, he explains.

Through his eyes, we see a world where everything's either white or black. As a police officer, he believes he stands on the side of righteousness. He even reassures a fellow police officer that what they do doesn't rob them of their place in heaven.

But when Vedha (Vijay Sethupathi), a criminal, arrives (in the best ‘hero’ introduction scene in years) later, Vikram’s idea of truth and justice doesn't look as simple anymore. In comparison, Vedha has killed fewer people, but Vikram believes it’s his job to send Vedha to hell.

In a wonderful interrogation scene, Vikram (dressed in white) sits across Vedha (dressed in black) and draws a line between good and evil. Vedha begins narrating his side to Vikram in the form of the three incidents that shaped his life. That thin line Vikram drew blurs, to a point where it’s impossible to see it any longer. Even their shirts change colour to a more similar shade as the film progresses.

Yet one wishes the film had never deviated from this existential crisis at its core. A small part of the second half starts taking the shape of a investigative thriller and in a film with such ambitions, these seem excessive, slowing down the film.

That aside, Vikram Vedha is a treat for the most parts, enjoyable not just for it's wonderful ‘who to root for’ conflict, but for the incredible acting of the leads and the spellbinding soundtrack. There’s a thin line that separates a good movie and great movie. On which side does this film fall? That’s the conflict I’m wrestling with.
